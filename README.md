# BoundaryAttack
r - Implemented a new feature to allow this to attack a deep learning model for electrocardiogram (ECG) data classification as a means of testing its robustness against real world noise - Optimized the attack algorithm to not only succeed 100% of the time against the model, but also with a minimal number of queries to reduce runtime by 30% - Improved the ECG classification model by creating a defense against this form of attack by analyzing the data in the frequency domain (Spectrograms)
