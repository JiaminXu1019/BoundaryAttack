# BoundaryAttack
- Responsible for analyzing developed code on a decision-based adversarial boundary attack for a deep learning image classifier
- Implemented a new feature to allow this algorithm to attack a deep learning model for electrocardiogram (ECG) data classification as a means of testing its robustness against real world noise
- Optimized the attack algorithm to not only succeed 100% of the time against the model, but also with a minimal number of iterations that reduced runtime by 25% and number of queries by 33%
- Improved the ECG classification model by creating a defense against this form of attack by analyzing the data in the frequency domain (Spectrograms)
- Utilized the Google Colab IDE, as well as other Python 3.6 Packages such as NumPy, MatplotLib, and SciKitLearn
